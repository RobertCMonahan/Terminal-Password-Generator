# Terminal Password Generator

This is a simple password generator and is completely used in the terminal.

It has been tested and built using Linux so if you use it on mac or windows please let me know if it works.

It can create passwords that include words for passwords that are more easily remembered but still quite secure. These words are chosen randomly from a word list of your choosing, options on changing the word list can be found in the settings menu.
